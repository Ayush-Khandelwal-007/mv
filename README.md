Q1 directory contains files to simulate the functionality of the SHELL command - 
      mymv file(1) file(2)... file(n) destination-directory
      
Q2 directory contains SHELL Script which will take multiple pathname/filename as source files, and one destination pathname from the user, check whether the source files and the destination pathname (directory) exists. If not, prompts to the user to correctly provide
the inputs. When it receives all correct inputs, moves all the source files to the specified destination directory using your mymv command.
